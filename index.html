        <div class="service-item">
          <h2>Nissan SR20DET</h2>
          <p>The SR20 first appeared in 89' in the Nissan Bluebird, however the SR20DET is generally known for its usage in Nissan Silvia and Nissan 180SX/200SX models. It's a robust 1998cc DOHC turbocharged engine with 16 valves and is popular in the drift scene</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-item">
          <h2>Honda B16B</h2>
          <p>The B16B was specially produced for JDM Civic EK9 Type R. The 1595cc engine featured Honda's legendary VTEC system and was capable of revving all the way up to 8900 RPM.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-item">
          <h2>Toyota 2JZ-GTE</h2>
          <p>The most powerful version of all JZ series, the 2JZ GTE is best known for powering MK IV Toyota Supra. However, it was originally built to homologate the Toyota Aristo for the Japanese Grand Touring Car Championship (JGTC).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-item">
          <h2> Nissan RB26DETT</h2>
          <p>The Rb26 first debuted on the R32 Nissan Skyline. The inline-six cast iron block was fitted with twin turbochargers and a DOHC head, with 4-valves per cylinder. The engine was capable of revving up to 8200RPM thanks to its over-square design.</p>

            <h1>Nissan Skyline</h1>
            <h2>1972-2002</h2>
            <p>When thinking of Nissan GTR, the current R35 comes to mind. But what made this model so famous was the Nissan Skyline GTR (R32), dubbed "Godzilla" by the Australian press due to its Japanese origins.

              The Nissan Skyline is a cult favourite since it has appeared in many video games and films. The R32, R33, and R34 are the rarest models right now and can't be easily found on used-car websites.</p>

            <h1>Mazda RX-7</h1>
            <h2>1992-2002</h2>
            <p>If you are a fan of the classic Initial D series, Ryosuke Takahashi's White Mazda RX-7 FC is definitely iconic by its own right. The FC2S was intentionally designed to follow the Porsche 924 and 944 trend, where pop-up headlights were popular for sports cars. Even today, the RX-7 looks so satisfying with its timeless design.

              The RX-7 uses a unique turbocharge rotary engine that is now very hard to come by in other cars. The FC2S and FD3S are highly sought after, with a price tag of over $100,000 in some used car listings sites.</p>

            <h1>Honda NS-X</h1>
            <h2>1990-2005</h2>
            <p>The Honda NSX or Acura NSX in North America was the first mass-produced car with an all aluminum body. The NS-X NA1 Japan's first supercar had gone through multiple tests before release and was set to rival Ferraris.

              This beast is powered by a 3.0litre V6 engine with Honda's VTEC system and was praised for its superb handling.
              
              It came equipped with pop-up headlights until 2002 when Honda made the worse decision ever to kill it off. The firm reported that the NSX only had 18,000 models sold globally from 1992-2005.</p>

            <h1>Toyota Supra</h1>
            <h2>1993-2002</h2>
            <p>Paul Walker said to Vin Diesel in the original Fast & Furious movie, "I owe you a 10-second car", after he wrecked what was one of the most sought after JDMs, the Toyota Supra MK IV. The Americans named the Toyota Supra MK IV as they didn't want to follow the official names given out by Toyota.

              Its legendary twin turbo-charged 2JZ and sophisticated body and wing designs are what made it a classic. When tuned up, the MKIV Supra could have up to 800hp, which is ridiculous for a Toyota. However, people loved the Toyota Supra because it was well-known for its reliability.
              
              Until today, the Toyota Supra MKIV fetches an insane price in the second-hand market because it is considered as one of the best cars ever made.</p>

            <h1>Nissan Silvia/240SX</h1>
            <h2>1989-2002</h2>
            <p>The Nissan Silvia S13 was launched in 1990 with a CA18 engine, which was later replaced with an iconic SR20 turbocharged engine with 200hp. The engine belts out 350 horses after tuning up, which was introduced to the S14 and S15 models.

              The legendary Nissan S-Chassis trio was referred to as the 180SX, 200SX, and 240SX, respectively. They were sold to different markets, namely Japan, Europe, and North America.
              
              The Nissan Silvia was a legendary car in the drifting scene because of how well it could drift and the customization options available, mainly in Japan.
              
              Some may argue that the S15 was the best of the three since it was the last S-Chassis model produced until 2002. The Silvia will be remembered as a low-slung sports car that was affordable to the masses while also cementing its place in drift culture.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title">About <span>JDM</span></h1>
        <h2>The Culture OF JDM</h2>
        <p>The acronym JDM actually stands for Japanese Domestic Market, meaning things tuned and sold for the Japanese automotive standards. JDM Culture is a part of the automotive universe that is slowly taking over the world. Much as the samurai in Japan's history, Japanese people today take very much pride in their domestic auto makers, and often choose their higher prices to the lower prices of imports. The sense of loyalty and pride they show carries over heavily to their car scene, which is the JDM Culture we see in movies and video games today, and as a result we see any version of any Japanese or other various cars with stickers that say "JDM as F***."</p>
